### Validation in Terraform
In Terraform, the `validation` block is used within a `variable`to ensure that the values passed to the variables meet specific conditions before applying the configuration. It's a great way to prevent errors by checking that user inputs are valid, ensuring that Terraform only proceeds with correct values.

### Example: Validating Instance Type
We'll validate that the instance_type variable is a valid EC2 instance type, and we'll only allow t2.micro, t2.medium, or t2.large.

```
variable "instance_type" {
  description = "The EC2 instance type"
  type        = string
  default     = "t2.micro"

  validation {
    condition     = contains(["t2.micro", "t2.medium", "t2.large"], var.instance_type)
    error_message = "The instance_type must be one of: t2.micro, t2.medium, t2.large"
  }
}

```
